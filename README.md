## Install

### Codex

Install target: `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>` (default: `~/.codex/skills/`)

Open Codex anywhere and paste this. Codex should do the rest.

> Install the Codex skills from `https://github.com/ray5273/stock-analysis-skill`. Use the local repo path `~/.codex/src/stock-analysis-skill`. If `~/.codex/src/stock-analysis-skill/.git` does not exist, create `~/.codex/src` and clone the repository there. If the repo already exists, update it with `git -C ~/.codex/src/stock-analysis-skill pull --ff-only`. Then run `cd ~/.codex/src/stock-analysis-skill && bash ./scripts/install-all-skills.sh`. If this is macOS and the Naver stack needs the Codex-specific fallback path, run `cd ~/.codex/src/stock-analysis-skill && bash ./scripts/install-codex-mac-naver.sh` instead. After install, confirm the skills were copied under `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/` and continue using the installed skills.

If you want to run the commands yourself instead of pasting the prompt:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/src
if [ -d ~/.codex/src/stock-analysis-skill/.git ]; then
  git -C ~/.codex/src/stock-analysis-skill pull --ff-only
else
  git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/ray5273/stock-analysis-skill ~/.codex/src/stock-analysis-skill
fi
cd ~/.codex/src/stock-analysis-skill
bash ./scripts/install-all-skills.sh
```

macOS Naver-only recovery path:

## Included Skills

Korean stock workflow shorthand: `kr-stock-plan -> kr-stock-dart-analysis -> kr-stock-data-pack -> kr-stock-analysis`

`kr-stock-plan` should act as the entry-point orchestrator: if the user starts there and did not explicitly ask for `plan only`, it should ask a short needs check, build the brief, decide whether this is a fresh memo, follow-up, or dated update, and continue through the downstream skills automatically.

Suggested handoff prompt:

```text
Use $kr-stock-plan as the entry point for Korean stock work. Have it first ask what the user actually needs, scope the request, treat my main question as the priority lens, route through $kr-stock-dart-analysis when filing precision matters, then build the dated fact base with $kr-stock-data-pack, and finish with $kr-stock-analysis unless the user explicitly asks to stop after planning.
```

Concrete example:

```text
Use $kr-stock-plan as the entry point for LG CNS. First ask what the user actually needs, scope it into a 12-24 month full decision memo, route through $kr-stock-dart-analysis if the latest filing basis, segment detail, backlog, or contract disclosures are important, then use $kr-stock-data-pack to assemble dated price, governance, valuation, chart, and outside-view inputs, and finish with $kr-stock-analysis for the final memo.
```

- `us-stock-analysis` for U.S. stocks and U.S.-listed ETFs
- `kr-stock-plan` for scoping Korean stock research into an execution-ready brief and acting as the default entry-point orchestrator for fresh memos, follow-up questions, and dated updates
- `kr-stock-dart-analysis` for precise DART filing extraction before broader Korean stock interpretation
- `kr-stock-data-pack` for gathering structured company fact packs before drafting, including optional outside-view inputs
- `kr-stock-analysis` for Korean stock quick views, full decision memos, event notes, pair compares, archetype-specific uncomfortable questions, decision-changing issues, structured stance, and follow-up research prompts
- `kr-stock-update` for dated follow-up updates to an existing Korean stock memo
- `kr-portfolio-monitor` for multi-position KRX portfolio snapshots via Kiwoom REST API or Yahoo fallback
- `kr-sector-plan` for scoping Korea sector research into an execution-ready brief
- `kr-sector-data-pack` for gathering structured sector fact packs before drafting
- `kr-sector-analysis` for Korea sector quick briefs and full reports
- `kr-sector-compare` for same-date Korea sector comparisons
- `kr-sector-audit` for findings-first review of an existing Korea sector memo
- `kr-sector-update` for dated incremental updates to an existing Korea sector memo

## How The Skills Work

These skills are designed to avoid stale-memory analysis.

Shared behavior:

- They are invoked explicitly through their skill names in Codex and Claude Code.
- Stock and portfolio skills treat prices, valuation, filings, guidance, portfolio positions, and news as time-sensitive, so the workflow starts by verifying current sources instead of relying on memory.
- Korea sector skills treat market metrics, policy changes, regulations, company exposure, and industry news as time-sensitive and keep source dates visible.
- When the workspace is writable, the default deliverable is a markdown report file in `analysis-example/<market>/<company>/memo.md` for stock work or `analysis-example/kr-sector/<sector>.md` for sector work, not just a chat answer.
- The report file should stay synchronized with the final answer, with an explicit "as of" date.

### `us-stock-analysis`

Primary instructions:

- [skills/us-stock-analysis/SKILL.md](skills/us-stock-analysis/SKILL.md)
- [skills/us-stock-analysis/references/workflow.md](skills/us-stock-analysis/references/workflow.md)
- [skills/us-stock-analysis/references/output-format.md](skills/us-stock-analysis/references/output-format.md)

Current behavior:

1. Define scope first: ticker, exchange, time horizon, comparison set, and whether the request is a full memo, comparison, pre-earnings note, or post-earnings note.
2. Verify fresh inputs from primary sources, starting with SEC filings and investor relations materials, then company news and market data checks.
3. Build a thesis around business quality, financial quality, capital allocation, catalysts, and risks.
4. Apply a valuation method that fits the company instead of forcing one template across all business models.
5. Write the final output in the default memo format when appropriate: summary, business and thesis, latest results, valuation, catalysts, risks, and what would change the view.

Bundled helpers:

- `scripts/peer-valuation.js` for comparable-company valuation tables
- `scripts/etf-overlap.js` for ETF overlap analysis
- `scripts/chart-basics.js` for basic technical trend and momentum reads from provided OHLCV data

### Korean Stock Skills

Primary instructions:

- [skills/kr-stock-plan/SKILL.md](skills/kr-stock-plan/SKILL.md)
- [skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/SKILL.md](skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/SKILL.md)
- [skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/references/script-inputs.md](skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/references/script-inputs.md)
- [skills/kr-stock-data-pack/SKILL.md](skills/kr-stock-data-pack/SKILL.md)
- [skills/kr-stock-analysis/SKILL.md](skills/kr-stock-analysis/SKILL.md)
- [skills/kr-stock-analysis/references/blended-source-notes.md](skills/kr-stock-analysis/references/blended-source-notes.md)
- [skills/kr-stock-update/SKILL.md](skills/kr-stock-update/SKILL.md)

Current behavior:

1. `kr-stock-plan` now starts with a short user-needs check, converts a vague Korean stock request into a clear security definition, output mode, key questions, and a recommended workflow, classifies the task as fresh memo versus follow-up versus dated update, and should continue into the downstream skills automatically unless the user asked for planning only.
2. `kr-stock-dart-analysis` acts as the filing-precision stage when the work depends on exact DART-backed result, segment, customer, backlog, contract, or disclosure wording detail, and should first ask a short filing-needs check when the target slice is still unclear.
   For long annual filings, it should also keep a `dart-reference.md` digest and `dart-cache.json` coverage cache so later updates can reuse section-level verification instead of re-reading the entire filing blindly.
   When the filing supports a broader stock memo, it should also run a DART recheck loop for thesis-critical claims instead of treating deep verification as optional.
3. `kr-stock-data-pack` collects dated price context, filings, results, governance facts, valuation inputs, chart inputs, and optional outside-view inputs before drafting, and should first confirm which pack blocks the user actually wants when that is not already defined.
4. `kr-stock-analysis` writes the final output as a `quick view`, `full memo`, `pre-earnings note`, `post-earnings note`, or `pair compare` for KRX-listed companies, and should first confirm the final decision frame or section priorities when they are still ambiguous.
   Full memos now behave like decision memos: they lead with `Decision Frame`, then surface `Uncomfortable Questions`, `Decision-Changing Issues`, `Structured Stance`, and `Follow-up Research Prompts` as fixed headers.
5. `kr-stock-update` preserves the original memo date, refreshes `최근 업데이트일`, and appends or replaces dated follow-up blocks under `## Update Log`.
6. `kr-stock-analysis` chart output now defaults to a three-chart view so price action is easier to read: one main PNG for `OHLC candlesticks + close line + MA5/20/60/120 + volume`, one overlay PNG for `Bollinger + Ichimoku + RSI14`, and one momentum PNG for `MACD + signal + histogram + ADX/DMI`.

Recommended pipeline:

```text
kr-stock-plan
  -> ask user needs, then lock security, mode, must-answer questions, and the user's priority question
  -> decide fresh memo vs follow-up vs dated update
  -> if filing precision matters: kr-stock-dart-analysis
  -> kr-stock-data-pack
  -> kr-stock-analysis
```

Routing guide:

- Start with `kr-stock-plan` when the request is still ambiguous on ticker, share class, horizon, compare mode, deliverable shape, or whether the user wants a fresh memo versus a follow-up. If the user started there for actual analysis work, continue automatically after the brief instead of waiting for another manual skill call.
- Insert `kr-stock-dart-analysis` when the conclusion depends on exact DART wording, standalone-quarter derivation, segment detail, customer concentration, backlog, or contract disclosures.
- Use `kr-stock-data-pack` to assemble the dated fact base around price, governance, valuation, chart, and outside-view inputs.
- Finish with `kr-stock-analysis` for the final memo, event note, quick view, or pair compare. For full memos, keep `analysis-example/kr/<company>/memo.md` as the canonical state artifact for later follow-up work.

Bundled helpers:

- `scripts/fetch-kr-chart.js` for current KRX daily bars
- `scripts/chart-basics.js` for technical reads plus three-part PNG chart output that separates the main trend view, the heavier overlays, and momentum panels for `MACD` and `ADX/DMI`
- `scripts/chart-basics.js` now draws KR main charts with candlesticks, a close line, and a current-price guide, and uses Korean chart labels when a Hangul-capable local font is available
- `scripts/chart-basics.js` writes the requested `--png-out` path as the main trend chart and writes sibling `*-overlay.png` and `*-momentum.png` files for the heavier indicator and momentum views
- `scripts/build-kr-universe-rs-cache.js` for integrated `KOSPI + KOSDAQ` relative-strength percentile cache files under `.tmp/kr-rs-cache/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`
- `scripts/kr-trend-rules.js` for `Minervini Trend Template` pass/fail plus `KRX 52주 신고가 리더십 점수` markdown blocks that can be embedded in the memo's `Chart and Positioning` section
- `scripts/valuation-bands.js` for 3-5 year valuation band summaries
- `scripts/peer-valuation.js` for comparable-company valuation tables
- `skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/scripts/extract-dart-sections.js` for building a section index from a text export of a DART filing
- `skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/scripts/normalize-browser-dart-export.js` for converting a Chrome extension browser export into the text format used by DART section extraction
- `skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/scripts/verify-dart-coverage.js` for checking whether the filing TOC was fully parsed
- `skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/scripts/build-dart-reference.js` for generating `dart-reference.md` and `dart-cache.json`
- `dart-cache.json` now reserves a `verifiedClaims` block for memo-critical claim verification results
- `skills/kr-stock-update/scripts/extract-report-baseline.js` for parsing memo metadata, update dates, and existing source URLs
- `skills/kr-stock-update/scripts/normalize-update-log.js` for rendering a normalized dated update block and writing it back into the memo

### `kr-portfolio-monitor`

Primary instructions:

- [skills/kr-portfolio-monitor/SKILL.md](skills/kr-portfolio-monitor/SKILL.md)
- [skills/kr-portfolio-monitor/references/workflow.md](skills/kr-portfolio-monitor/references/workflow.md)
- [skills/kr-portfolio-monitor/references/output-format.md](skills/kr-portfolio-monitor/references/output-format.md)
- [skills/kr-portfolio-monitor/references/mcp-setup.md](skills/kr-portfolio-monitor/references/mcp-setup.md)

Current behavior:

1. Check `kiwoom-mcp` connectivity first, then retrieve account balance, live prices, and 30-day daily bars in one pass.
2. Restrict live coverage to domestic KRX holdings supported by Kiwoom REST API. Overseas stocks are out of scope for this skill and must not be implied as covered.
3. Compute SMA20 deviation and RSI14 per holding, flag stretched positions, and summarize total unrealized P&L.
4. Write the rolling snapshot to `analysis-example/kr/portfolio-snapshot.md` when the workspace is writable.
5. If live MCP access is unavailable, fall back to `portfolio-snapshot.js` with manual KRX holdings JSON and Yahoo Finance market data.

Bundled helpers:

- `skills/kr-stock-analysis/scripts/portfolio-snapshot.js` for KRX portfolio snapshots from manual JSON input
- `scripts/test-kiwoom-token.js` for checking Kiwoom OAuth token issuance from `.env.kiwoom`
- `scripts/run-kiwoom-mcp.js` for launching `kiwoom-mcp` locally with repo-managed environment variables

- [skills/kr-sector-audit/SKILL.md](skills/kr-sector-audit/SKILL.md)
- [skills/kr-sector-update/SKILL.md](skills/kr-sector-update/SKILL.md)

Current behavior:

1. `kr-sector-plan` converts a vague Korea sector request into a clear scope, output mode, and section outline.
2. `kr-sector-data-pack` collects dated market metrics, policy events, regulation changes, value-chain facts, and representative public-company references.
3. `kr-sector-analysis` writes either a `quick brief` or a `full report` under `analysis-example/kr-sector/<sector>.md`.
4. `kr-sector-compare` keeps cross-sector comparisons on a same-date basis and ranks the setup only when the evidence supports it.
5. `kr-sector-audit` reviews an existing memo with findings first, prioritizing source, date, and logic integrity over style comments.
6. `kr-sector-update` preserves the original memo date, refreshes `최근 업데이트일`, and appends or replaces a dated block under `## Update Log`.

### Claude.ai DART Browser Workflow

When Codex or Claude Code cannot directly drive the DART viewer, use the Chrome extension under [`integrations/claude-dart-extension/`](integrations/claude-dart-extension/README.md).

1. Open a supported DART viewer page: `https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do*`
2. Let the extension auto-extract the page
3. Click `Save Export` when the popup shows `Export ready`
4. Normalize the saved file:

```text
node skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/scripts/normalize-browser-dart-export.js --input dart-browser-export.json --output dart-text.txt
node skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/scripts/extract-dart-sections.js --input dart-text.txt --output sections.json
node skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/scripts/verify-dart-coverage.js --input sections.json --output coverage.json
```

5. Attach the JSON export in Claude.ai or continue the downstream DART scripts locally
