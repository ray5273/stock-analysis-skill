# Skills Catalog & Behavior

23 skills shipped in `kr-research-kit`. Korean stock workflow shorthand:

```text
kr-stock-plan -> kr-stock-chart -> kr-stock-dart-analysis -> kr-stock-data-pack -> kr-stock-analysis
```

`kr-stock-plan` should act as the entry-point orchestrator: if the user starts there and did not explicitly ask for `plan only`, it should ask a short needs check, build the brief, decide whether this is a fresh memo, follow-up, or dated update, and continue through the downstream skills automatically.

Suggested handoff prompt:

```text
Use $kr-stock-plan as the entry point for Korean stock work. Have it first ask what the user actually needs, scope the request, treat my main question as the priority lens, route through $kr-stock-chart when chart work is needed, route through $kr-stock-dart-analysis when filing precision matters, then build the dated fact base with $kr-stock-data-pack, and finish with $kr-stock-analysis unless the user explicitly asks to stop after planning.
```

## Skill list

- `us-stock-analysis` — U.S. stocks and U.S.-listed ETFs.

- `kr-stock-chart` — chart-only KRX output and reusable chart artifacts (`chart-data.json`, `chart-analysis.md`, five PNG panels, CSV sidecars, optional rule-screen outputs).
- `kr-stock-dart-analysis` — precise DART filing extraction before broader Korean stock interpretation.
- `kr-stock-data-pack` — structured company fact packs before drafting, including optional outside-view inputs.
- `kr-stock-analysis` — Korean stock quick views, full decision memos, event notes, pair compares, archetype-specific uncomfortable questions, decision-changing issues, structured stance, and follow-up research prompts.

- `kr-naver-blog-publish` — converts a memo to a Naver SmartEditor draft (publish requires explicit user approval).
- `kr-web-browse` — generic non-Naver browser wrapper used by the analyst-report chain.
- `kr-sector-plan` / `kr-sector-data-pack` / `kr-sector-analysis` / `kr-sector-compare` / `kr-sector-audit` / `kr-sector-update` — Korea sector workflow (brief, fact pack, full report, same-date compare, audit, dated update).

## How the skills work

These skills are designed to avoid stale-memory analysis. Shared behavior:

- Invoked explicitly through their skill names in Codex and Claude Code.
- Stock and portfolio skills treat prices, valuation, filings, guidance, portfolio positions, and news as time-sensitive — the workflow starts by verifying current sources instead of relying on memory.
- Korea sector skills treat market metrics, policy changes, regulations, company exposure, and industry news as time-sensitive and keep source dates visible.
- When the workspace is writable, the default deliverable is a markdown report file in `analysis-example/<market>/<company>/memo.md` for stock work or `analysis-example/kr-sector/<sector>.md` for sector work — not just a chat answer.
- The report file stays synchronized with the final answer, with an explicit "as of" date.

### `us-stock-analysis`

Primary instructions:

- [skills/us-stock-analysis/SKILL.md](../skills/us-stock-analysis/SKILL.md)
- [skills/us-stock-analysis/references/workflow.md](../skills/us-stock-analysis/references/workflow.md)
- [skills/us-stock-analysis/references/output-format.md](../skills/us-stock-analysis/references/output-format.md)

Current behavior:

1. Define scope first: ticker, exchange, time horizon, comparison set, and whether the request is a full memo, comparison, pre-earnings note, or post-earnings note.
2. Verify fresh inputs from primary sources, starting with SEC filings and IR materials, then company news and market data checks.
3. Build a thesis around business quality, financial quality, capital allocation, catalysts, and risks.
4. Apply a valuation method that fits the company instead of forcing one template across all business models.
5. Write the final output in the default memo format when appropriate: summary, business and thesis, latest results, valuation, catalysts, risks, and what would change the view.

Bundled helpers: `scripts/peer-valuation.js`, `scripts/etf-overlap.js`, `scripts/chart-basics.js`.

Current behavior:

1. `kr-stock-plan` starts with a short user-needs check, converts a vague Korean stock request into a clear security definition, output mode, key questions, and a recommended workflow, classifies the task as fresh memo vs follow-up vs dated update, and continues into the downstream skills automatically unless the user asked for planning only.
2. `kr-stock-chart` owns KRX chart generation. It fetches about 2 years of daily bars by default, writes `chart-data.json` and `chart-analysis.md`, renders the five PNG chart panels plus CSV sidecars, and can add a rule-screen block when requested. The technical read surfaces today's `MA5 / 20 / 60 / 120 / 200` price levels explicitly.
3. `kr-stock-dart-analysis` acts as the filing-precision stage when the work depends on exact DART-backed result, segment, customer, backlog, contract, or disclosure wording detail, and first asks a short filing-needs check when the target slice is still unclear. For long annual filings, it keeps a `dart-reference.md` digest and `dart-cache.json` coverage cache so later updates can reuse section-level verification instead of re-reading the entire filing blindly. When the filing supports a broader stock memo, it also runs a DART recheck loop for thesis-critical claims instead of treating deep verification as optional.
4. `kr-stock-data-pack` collects dated price context, filings, results, governance facts, valuation inputs, chart inputs, and optional outside-view inputs before drafting, and ingests `kr-stock-chart` artifacts rather than rebuilding them.
5. `kr-stock-analysis` writes the final output as a `quick view`, `full memo`, `pre-earnings note`, `post-earnings note`, or `pair compare` for KRX-listed companies, and first confirms the final decision frame or section priorities when they are still ambiguous. Full memos lead with `Decision Frame`, then surface `Uncomfortable Questions`, `Decision-Changing Issues`, `Structured Stance`, and `Follow-up Research Prompts` as fixed headers.
6. `kr-stock-update` preserves the original memo date, refreshes `최근 업데이트일`, and appends or replaces dated follow-up blocks under `## Update Log`.

Recommended pipeline:

```text
kr-stock-plan
  -> ask user needs, then lock security, mode, must-answer questions, and the user's priority question
  -> decide fresh memo vs follow-up vs dated update
  -> if chart work matters: kr-stock-chart
  -> if filing precision matters: kr-stock-dart-analysis
  -> if sell-side consensus matters: kr-analyst-report-discover -> kr-analyst-report-fetch -> kr-analyst-report-insight
  -> if foreign-IB views matter: kr-foreign-analyst
  -> if independent retail voices matter: kr-naver-blogger -> kr-naver-insight
  -> kr-stock-data-pack
  -> kr-stock-analysis
```

Analyst-report pipeline details:

- `kr-web-browse` is a thin non-Naver browser wrapper; it reuses the gstack `browse` binary vendored under `kr-naver-browse` and exposes `browseText`, `browseLinks`, and `downloadFile` for sibling skills.
- `kr-analyst-report-discover` scrapes sell-side reports from `consensus.hankyung.com` (primary) with `finance.naver.com/research` as fallback. Default lookback is 365 days (`--lookback-days` overrides). Login-gated reports are kept with `requiresAuth: true`. Output: `.tmp/analyst-report-cache/index/<ticker>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`.
- `kr-analyst-report-fetch` downloads each non-auth PDF and extracts text via the shared `skills/kr-stock-dart-analysis/scripts/extract-pdf-text.py` helper (requires `pypdf`). Output: `.tmp/analyst-report-cache/extracted/<ticker>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`.
- `kr-analyst-report-insight` renders a 7-section Markdown digest (consensus snapshot, broker table, recent reports with verbatim key-point bullets, divergences, TP trajectory with ASCII sparkline, source-quality footer). Snippets are quoted verbatim at ~1500 chars per report; it is a standalone deliverable and also the ingestion source for `kr-stock-data-pack` → `External Views` with `Source role: sell-side consensus`.
- `kr-foreign-analyst` searches Korean news for foreign investment-bank coverage, extracts broker / rating / target-price / date metadata from article text, and renders a memo-ready `## Street / Alternative Views` block. Treat it as secondary news-sourced evidence, not a primary report or filing fact.

Routing guide:

- Start with `kr-stock-plan` when the request is still ambiguous on ticker, share class, horizon, compare mode, deliverable shape, or whether the user wants a fresh memo vs a follow-up. If the user started there for actual analysis work, continue automatically after the brief instead of waiting for another manual skill call.
- Insert `kr-stock-chart` when the user wants chart-only output or when the memo should ingest reusable chart artifacts.
- Insert `kr-stock-dart-analysis` when the conclusion depends on exact DART wording, standalone-quarter derivation, segment detail, customer concentration, backlog, or contract disclosures.
- Use `kr-stock-data-pack` to assemble the dated fact base around price, governance, valuation, chart, and outside-view inputs.
- Finish with `kr-stock-analysis` for the final memo, event note, quick view, or pair compare. For full memos, keep `analysis-example/kr/<company>/memo.md` as the canonical state artifact for later follow-up work.

Current behavior:

1. Check `kiwoom-mcp` connectivity first, then retrieve account balance, live prices, and 30-day daily bars in one pass.
2. Restrict live coverage to domestic KRX holdings supported by Kiwoom REST API. Overseas stocks are out of scope.
3. Compute SMA20 deviation and RSI14 per holding, flag stretched positions, and summarize total unrealized P&L.
